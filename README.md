# Dployme

**One-click deployment from GitHub to your local machine with global domain access**

## Core Idea

Dployme bridges the gap between local development and public accessibility by providing a seamless deployment pipeline that connects your GitHub repositories directly to your local machine through secure tunnels. Instead of dealing with complex cloud deployments or expensive hosting for simple project showcases, Dployme generates custom deployment scripts that automatically containerize your applications and expose them to the internet via custom or auto-generated domains.

The magic happens in three simple steps: authenticate with GitHub on our hosted dashboard, select any repository with a Dockerfile, and download a personalized script that handles everything from container building to tunnel creation. Within minutes, your local application is running in a Docker container and accessible worldwide through a clean domain name, perfect for portfolio demonstrations, client previews, or quick prototyping.

## ‚ú® Features

- **GitHub Integration**: Seamlessly browse and deploy from your private and public repositories
- **Zero Configuration**: Just ensure your repo has a Dockerfile - we handle the rest
- **Custom Domains**: Bring your own domain or use our auto-generated subdomains
- **Secure Tunneling**: Powered by Cloudflare Tunnel for reliable, secure connections
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live deployment status, logs, and container health from the dashboard
- **Cross-Platform**: Generated scripts work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Multi-Project Support**: Run multiple applications simultaneously on different subdomains
- **No Cloud Costs**: Deploy to your own hardware - no hosting fees

### 1. **Connect & Configure**
- Login with GitHub OAuth
- Browse your repositories
- Select deployment target
- Configure domain preferences

### 2. **Download & Deploy**
- Download custom deployment script
- Run script on your local machine
- Script handles cloning, building, and tunnel setup

### 3. **Monitor & Manage**
- View real-time deployment status
- Access container logs
- Manage multiple deployments
- Share public URLs

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Visit the [Dployme Dashboard](https://Dployme.dev)
2. Authenticate with your GitHub account
3. Select a repository with a Dockerfile
4. Configure your deployment settings
5. Download and run the generated script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x deploy-myapp.sh
   ./deploy-myapp.sh
   ```
6. Your app is now live at `https://myapp-abc123.Dployme.dev`
